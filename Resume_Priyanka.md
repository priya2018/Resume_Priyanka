This project is to provide the servicing to windows operating system (7/8/8.1/10 and future OS releases) that were already released into the market. It involves automation testing, regression testing, debugging of the components in windows OS as part of daily and monthly serviceability releases and security fixes. Debugging with Microsoft internal tools and the adhoc, manual and automated testing will be carried out regularly on both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows architectures and ARM platforms. Daily triaging and analysis of the test results need to complete before next Windows builds come out and enable higher management to make right decisions on windows serviceability and fixes. All the test results and data on regressions are kept on PowerBI reports that are maintained and updated daily.
